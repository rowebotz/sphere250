## üìö Content Customization

### Adding New Questions

Questions are stored in the `questionBank` object in the JavaScript section. Each difficulty level has its own array:

```javascript
const questionBank = {
    easy: [
        {
            question: "Your question here?",
            answers: ["Correct Answer", "Wrong 1", "Wrong 2", "Wrong 3"],
            correct: 0  // Index of correct answer
        }
    ],
    medium: [...],
    hard: [...]
};
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep 7 questions per difficulty level for optimal balance
- Ensure answer index 0 is always the correct answer (randomization happens automatically)
- Test questions for clarity and accuracy

### Adding New Fun Facts

Fun facts appear at the end of each quiz:

```javascript
const funFacts = [
    "Your interesting historical fact here...",
    "Another fascinating detail...",
    // Add more facts
];
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Daily Rotation System
The game uses a **seed-based randomization** system to ensure:
- Everyone sees the same questions on the same day
- Questions rotate daily without server-side logic
- Difficulty distribution changes based on day of week

### localStorage Tracking
The game stores:
- `lastPlayedDate` - Prevents multiple plays per day
- `todayScore` - Player's most recent score

### Play Again Logic
When a player clicks "Play Again":
- The page reloads
- localStorage is checked
- If already played today, shows "come back tomorrow" screen
- If new day, allows new game

## üîß Customization Options

### Changing Colors
Search for hex colors in the CSS section and replace:
- `#2D1870` - Primary purple
- `#7C756D` - Secondary taupe

### Adjusting Difficulty Distribution
Modify the `selectDailyQuestions()` function to change how questions are distributed across the week.

### Changing Timer Duration
Find `timeRemaining = 15;` and adjust the value (in seconds).

### Modifying Speed Bonus
Locate the speed bonus calculation:
```javascript
const speedBonus = Math.floor(basePoints * 0.5 * (timeRemaining / 15));
```
Change `0.5` to adjust bonus percentage (0.5 = 50%).

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The game automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full-width layout with side-by-side buttons
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and font sizes
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout, larger touch targets

## üîó External Links

The game includes two external links:
1. **Explore Sphere's 250th Collection** ‚Üí `https://www.sphere-ed.org/collection/americas-250th-birthday`
2. **Sphere Education Initiatives** ‚Üí `https://www.sphere-ed.org`

## üìä Analytics Integration (Optional)

To add analytics, insert your tracking code before the closing `</head>` tag:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR-ID');
</script>
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Already Played Today" shows incorrectly
- Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
- Check browser date/time settings

### Questions not randomizing
- Verify the seed-based randomization is working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Styling issues
- Ensure Google Fonts is loading (check network tab)
- Verify browser supports CSS Grid and Flexbox

### Timer not working
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Ensure browser supports setInterval/clearInterval
